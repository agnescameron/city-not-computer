          <h1>a right to the computer</h1>
          <p>Right now, our image of computation is pretty limited. Where there was once a lively proliferation of different websites, 70% of web traffic is routed through sites belonging to Facebook and Google. Much of our local computation (on our phones and computers) is mediated by apps, few of which we have any control over. As black-boxed and opaque computational systems increasingly permeate public space, what tools do we have to change that space through changing computation? What possibilities are offered in computing history, and how might we construct a different future?

          In this essay, I will look at the computer in its relation to the city in terms of care and maintenance, in three parts. Firstly, I will explore some alternate histories to the computer as ‘control system’. Second, I will focus more specifically on the cybernetic ideal of self-regulation, and tie it to concurrent narratives of maintenance and care. Third, I will consider the computer in relation to place and space in terms of theories of information (and who, and what creates it).

          Ultimately, I want to move beyond the critique of ‘the city as computer’, and look instead at how we might open up computation to include the kinds of labour that a cybernetic ideal of the city lacks. For better or worse, we are all taking part in systems of care and control, of computation and of information processing.</p>
          
          <h2> control systems </h2>

        <p>Many histories of computing centre on a narrative that cycles in a tight loop between military and corporate interests. This is, after all a fairly linear projection back from where we are today, the blossoming of corporate giants (Facebook, Amazon, Google, then Apple, Microsoft) built on innovation from utopian, partly DARPA-funded laboratories (Xerox PARC, the Media Lab, Bell Labs), which themselves were populated by many of the men and inventions that sprung from two World Wars’ worth of innovation.

        The field of Cybernetics has its roots in Norbert Wiener’s design of an Anti-Aircraft gun, and Information Theory (a precursor to the modern science of communications) in Claude Shannon’s work on wartime cryptography. The Internet itself was prefigured by ARPAnet, a military defence programme inspired by Viet Cong tactics of distribution and dispersal.

        Is it any wonder, then (we say) that the internet is controlled by corporate surveillance machines over which we have no control? This narrative dominates because it largely makes sense, and builds up many of the elements of our present condition: one in which platform capitalism and yawning inequality feel all too inevitable.</p>
